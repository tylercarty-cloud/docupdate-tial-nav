Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone.

In one arm of this study, we will investigate the safety and immunologic activity of RNA-LP vaccines in pediatric patients with recurrent pHGG.

The investigators have also shown that intravenous administration of tumor mRNA loaded lipid particles (LPs) localizes primarily to lung, transfect antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lead to an activated T cell response for induction of anti-tumor immunity. In contrast to other formulations, RNA-LPs recruit multiple arms of the immune system (i.e. innate/adaptive), and remodel the systemic/intratumoral immune milieu, which remain potent barriers for vaccine, cellular, and checkpoint inhibiting immunotherapies. After only a single RNA-LP vaccine, the bulk of systemic and intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs) in mice display an activated phenotype; these activated DCs (harvested from tumors) expand antigen specific T cell immunity. In immunologically resistant pulmonary osteosacroma murine tumor models (i.e. K7M2), RNA-LPs induce robust anti-tumor efficacy in settings where immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e. anti-PD-L1 therapy) do not confer therapeutic benefit.

There also is little known about the effects of what is provided in the pump data, in correlation to quality-of-life following dLVAD implantation.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to prospectively analyze normal and abnormal pump data through pump operations such as suction events, low flow alarms as well as other adventitious alarms, PI events and power cable disconnects greater than 20 seconds, from the HeartMate 3 ® dLVAD in order to clinically correlate this data to quality of life, frailty and other various medical conditions and adverse events as defined by the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (Intermacs). This will be achieved through two aims: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of dLVAD pump operations data on clinical practice application (quality of life, frailty and various medical conditions, and adverse events such as GIB, RHF, infection, hypertension, arrhythmias and stroke); and 2) Evaluate correlations and relationships of longitudinal normal and abnormal dLVAD pump operations data, to demographic and clinical variables.

TRC102 is in a class of drugs called antineoplastic agents. It blocks the ability of a cell to repair damage to its deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill tumor cells. It may also help some anticancer drugs work better. Pemetrexed is in a class of medications called antifolate antineoplastic agents. It works by stopping cells from using folic acid to make DNA and may kill tumor cells. Cisplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy sources to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.

* At the patient level, the intervention will result in higher levels of food security, self- efficacy for dietary behaviors, and higher diet quality than standard care.
* At the provider level, the intervention will be feasible, acceptable, appropriate, and able to enhance individualized care for patient wellness.

The proposed interventional aim to compare meniscal repair augmentation methods is novel, as the direct comparison of these outcome measures has not been previously described. Because of the known benefit of biologic augmentation of meniscal repair, the investigators hypothesize that the repair failure rate for both cohorts will be lower than the reported repair failure rate for isolated tears without biologic augmentation; the investigators also hypothesize that BMVP of the intercondylar notch will clinically be significantly better than intra-articular PRP injection.

Dinutuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called GD2, which is found on the surface of neuroblastoma cells, but is not present on many healthy or normal cells in the body. When dinutuximab binds to the neuroblastoma cells, it helps signal the immune system to kill the tumor cells. This helps the cells of the immune system kill the cancer cells, this is a type of immunotherapy. When chemotherapy and immunotherapy are given together, during the same treatment cycle, it is called chemoimmunotherapy. This clinical trial randomly assigns patients to receive either standard chemotherapy and surgery or chemoimmunotherapy (chemotherapy plus dinutuximab) and surgery during Induction therapy. Chemotherapy drugs administered during Induction include, cyclophosphamide, topotecan, cisplatin, etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin. These drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Upon completion of 5 cycles of Induction therapy, a disease evaluation is completed to determine how well the treatment worked. If the tumor responds to therapy, patients receive a tandem transplantation with stem cell rescue. If the tumor has little improvement or worsens, patients receive chemoimmunotherapy on Extended Induction. During Extended Induction, dinutuximab is given with irinotecan, temozolomide.

Brentuximab vedotin is in a class of medications called antibody-drug conjugates. It is made of a monoclonal antibody called brentuximab that is linked to a cytotoxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30 positive lymphoma cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, dacarbazine, and procarbazine hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Vincristine is in a class of medications called vinca alkaloids. It works by stopping cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids.

* To check the safety of ASP1002 in people with certain solid tumors.
* To check if the people can tolerate ASP1002.
* To find a suitable dose of ASP1002. This study will be in 2 parts. In Part 1, different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of ASP1002. Any medical problems will be recorded at each dose. This is done to find suitable doses of ASP1002 to use in Part 2 of the study.

In Part 2, other different small groups of people will receive doses of ASP1002 that worked the best in Part 1.

People in this study will be adults with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors with high levels of a protein called claudin 4. The people's cancer will have either spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or spread to tissue close by (locally advanced).

They will have been previously treated with available standard therapies or refused to receive those treatments.

In both parts of the study, ASP1002 (the study treatment) will be given to people slowly through a tube into a vein. This is called an infusion. This will happen every week, every other week, or every 3 weeks, in treatment cycles. Treatment cycles may be 21 days or 28 days long. People in this study will continue treatment for up to 2 years until: they have medical problems that prevent them from continuing treatment; their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; they ask to stop treatment; they do not come back for treatment.

During the study, people will visit the clinic several times for a health check. This includes standard safety checks and reporting any medical problems. Every few weeks, the study doctors will check if each person's cancer has stayed the same or got worse. This will be done by scans (CT or MRI scans).

The investigators propose use of NIRS technology in patients with diagnosis of tibial fracture and acute compartment syndrome to detect / document impaired perfusion of the anterior compartment of the leg, as compared to their non-broken leg. The investigators also propose measurement of intramuscular glucose level in the affected leg and compare it to a fingerstick glucose to detect relative hypoglycemia in the affected muscular compartment. If proven effective, NIRS, or IM glucose, or both techniques could be used for clinical monitoring of patients with tibial fractures at risk for acute compartment syndrome.",Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS),"Use of NIRS to detect changes in perfusion in tibial fractures with acute compartment syndrome or leg ischemia due vascular compromise.: NIRS sensors will be applied to the skin overlying anterior compartment of the injuries and uninjured legs. Uninjured leg will serve as a control leg. Readings from both legs will be recorded continuously until patient enters OR for emergent surgery. At that point NIRS sensor will be removed to allow skin prep for surgical procedure. NIRS sensor will be re-applied to the skin at the completion of the surgery before leg is wrapped with the dressing. Monitoring of both extremities will be continued for 72 hours.

If NIRS readings of the affected extremity will be reliably lower as compared to unaffected extremity, and that difference will reverse after surgery (fasciotomy), where NIRS reading of the affected extremity should be at least equal to or, most likely, higher than those of the unaffected extremity, that will prove that NIRS monitoring can be used to detect acute compartment syndrome and muscular ischemia.

At the same time fingerstick will be performed and capillary glucose will be measured. Both glucose readings will be recorded.

If intramuscular glucose readings in the affected extremity show relative hypoglycemia, i.e. glucose in the affected compartment will be lower than the fingerstick performed at the hand at the same time, that will prove that intramuscular glucose monitoring can be used to detect acute compartment syndrome and muscular ischemia.

Despite decades of promising preclinical and clinical investigations in trauma, investigators understanding of these entities is still incomplete, and few therapies have shown success. During severe trauma, bone marrow granulocyte stores are rapidly released into the peripheral circulation. This release subsequently induces the expansion and repopulation of empty or evacuated space by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Although the patient experiences an early loss of bone marrow myeloid-derived cells, stem cell expansion is largely skewed towards the repopulation of the myeloid lineage/compartment. The hypothesis is that this 'emergency myelopoiesis' is critical for the survival of the severely traumatized and further, failure of the emergency myelopoietic response is associated with global immunosuppression and susceptibility to secondary infection. Also, identifying the release of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the circulation of human severe trauma subjects. This process is driven by HSCs in the bone marrow of trauma subjects. Additionally, MDSCs may have a profound effect on the nutritional status of the host. The appearance of these MDSCs after trauma is associated with a loss of muscle tissue in these subjects. This muscle loss and possible increased catabolism have huge effects on long term outcomes for these subjects. It is the investigator's goal to understand the differences that occur in these in HSCs and muscle cells as opposed to non-injured and non-infected controls.

Trametinib acts by targeting a protein in cells called MEK and disrupting tumor growth. Everolimus is a drug that may block another pathway in tumor cells that can help tumors grow.

Some of the recently FDA-approved therapies for congenital and acquired hematologic conditions have not yet demonstrated long-term safety and effectiveness beyond the pivotal trials that led to their approval. In addition, results from well controlled, pivotal studies often cannot be replicated once a therapy has been approved for general use.2,3,4,5

In 2019 alone, the FDA has issued approvals for 24 new therapies for congenital and acquired hematologic conditions.6 In addition, almost 10,000 new studies for hematologic diseases are currently registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov.7

With this increase in potential new therapies possible, it is imperative that clinicians and clinical researchers in the field of non-neoplastic hematology have a uniform, secure, unbiased, and enduring method to collect long-term safety and efficacy data. As emphasized in a recently published review, accurate, uniform and quality national data collection is critical in clinical research, particularly for longitudinal cohort studies covering a lifetime of biologic risk.8",,"To determine the safety of therapies used in the treatment of participants with congenital or acquired non-neoplastic, bleeding and clotting disorders and connective tissue disorders with bleeding tendency (blood disorders).: Safety will be measured by those events in the European Safety Surveillance (EUHASS)1:

With advancements in neuromodulatory technologies, increasingly more of these individuals elect to undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery in order to control symptoms of the disease, including refractory tremor, medication-induced dyskinesias, and PD-associated dystonia. The two most common DBS neural targets for controlling these symptoms are the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Recent meta-analyses have shown relative equivalence between these two sites at controlling core PD symptoms. To date, there is not conclusive evidence regarding the potential impact of DBS to GPi or STN on laryngeal-mediated functions of voice, swallowing, and cough, and consequently no guidance on whether these outcomes should be considered when selecting DBS target. Therefore, the goal of this project is to determine the impact of DBS neural target (STN versus GPi), lead location within the target, laterality, and stimulation settings on voice, swallow and cough function in people with PD. The larynx is an important player in each of these functions, and our central hypothesis is that spread of stimulation to corticobulbar fibers in the genu of the internal capsule have deleterious effects on laryngeal motor control, resulting in voice, swallow, and cough dysfunction. We have identified three specific aims for this application: 1.) To compare laryngeal function during volitional voice tasks pre-post DBS, and when DBS placement is bilateral versus unilateral for STN and GPi targets. 2.)

The purpose of this study is to find out if a medicine called BI 765423 can improve lung function in people with IPF. The study will compare BI 765423 with a placebo to see if there is a difference in lung capacity after 3 months of treatment and will also look at changes in certain markers related to lung health.

Participants are put into two groups randomly, which means by chance. One group receives the study medicine, and the other group receives a placebo. Placebo looks like BI 765423 but does not contain any study medicine. The study medicine is given as an infusion into a vein every four weeks.

Participants are in the study for 8-10 months. During the study, participants may continue their regular treatment for IPF.

Asparaginase is part of the standard of care chemotherapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL), and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). However, in adolescent and young adults (AYA) ages 15-39 years, liver toxicity from asparaginase is common and often prevents delivery of planned chemotherapy, thereby potentially compromising outcomes. Some groups of people may also be at higher risk for liver damage due to the presence of fat in the liver even before starting chemotherapy. Patients who are of Japanese descent, Native Hawaiian, Hispanic or Latinx may be at greater risk for liver damage from chemotherapy for this reason. Carnitine is a naturally occurring nutrient that is part of a typical diet and is also made by the body.

This trial also studies the outcomes of patients with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LLy) when treated with ALL therapy without inotuzumab ozogamicin. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called inotuzumab, linked to a type of chemotherapy called calicheamicin. Inotuzumab attaches to cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers calicheamicin to kill them. Other drugs used in the chemotherapy regimen, such as cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, methotrexate, leucovorin, mercaptopurine, prednisone, thioguanine, vincristine, and pegaspargase or calaspargase pegol work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

• BTK Target lesions cannot be contiguous with inflow lesions and at least 3 cm of normal artery should extend beyond the tibial plateau to ensure there is no overlap.
• Target lesions must have a diameter stenosis of ≥ 70% (including total occlusions) by visual estimate and must be indicated for PTA treatment.
• Target vessel reference diameter(s) are ≥ 2mm and ≤ 4mm. Note: the SELUTION SLR 014 DEB and the control PTA balloon size cannot exceed 4.0 mm.
• Target lesions must be confined to a single target vessel. NOTE: Subjects with other non-target BTK lesions in separate non-target vessels may be enrolled, provided that the non-target lesions have been successfully treated (residual stenosis ≤ 30% with no distal embolization or flow limiting ≥ Grade C dissection). NOTE: Any adjunctive therapies are permitted for the treatment of non-target BTK lesions, but no DEB or DES may be used.
• Any target lesion must be ≥ 30 mm in length and the total combined length of all target lesions must be ≤ 140 mm (total treatment length ≤ 150 mm allowing for 5 mm proximal and distal shoulder treatment).

• If the target vessel is the peroneal artery, the artery must demonstrate normal terminal branching.
• If the target vessel is the anterior tibial (AT) or posterior tibial (PT) artery, the artery must reconstitute ≥ 1 cm above the tibiotalar joint to provide an intact runoff vessel (AT: dorsalis pedis; PT: plantar artery).
• If the target vessel is the tibio-peroneal trunk, outflow for either the peroneal OR the posterior tibial artery must be patent (≤ 50% stenosis by visual estimate).
• Subjects is free of significant inflow vessel disease or any inflow disease has been successfully treated (see angiographic inclusion # 9). Significant inflow disease is defined as ≥ 50% stenosis by visual estimate. Inflow vessels include the ipsilateral common iliac, external iliac, common femoral, profunda femoris, superficial femoral or popliteal artery proximal (≥ 3 cm) to the tibial plateau. Note: If access site doesn't permit angiographic imaging of the common iliac and common femoral artery (CFA), then non-invasive imaging (CTA or MRA) must be provided to exclude presence of significant inflow disease. If non-invasive imaging is not possible, a DUS of the CFA with a multiphasic wave form excluding significant disease AND a palpable ipsilateral femoral pulse must be documented.
• Subjects with significant inflow disease (≥ 50% stenosis by visual estimate) must have documented successful treatment before randomizing the subject. Successful treatment of inflow disease is defined as ≤ 30% final residual stenosis and no distal embolization or flow-limiting \> Grade C dissection.

One treatment being studied is dry needling, a technique where a small needle is inserted into a specific area of muscle to help relieve pain. So far, the research on dry needling for low back pain hasn't been clear, and it's hard to know when and for whom it will work best. This study aims to figure out how dry needling works to help people with chronic low back pain by looking at the underlying factors. By understanding how dry needling helps people, we can develop a more targeted approach to treatment, which could lead to better outcomes for people with chronic low back pain. The goal of this study is to identify the factors that make dry needling effective for people with chronic low back pain, so that this this information can be used to provide more personalized and effective care.

Eligible participants will attend 5 research sessions lasting approximately 1 hour and complete 2 online surveys. At 3 of those sessions, participants will receive dry needling to their low back.

As part of the research, participants will complete questionnaires related to how pain effects their life. Participants will also undergo testing for muscle stiffness, low back mobility and strength, and pain sensitivity.

* Be 18-65 years of age
* Have low back pain for at least 3 months",Dry needling,"Pain intensity: Pain intensity will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory's (BPI) pain intensity sub-scale.

The pain intensity domains are measured using the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) anchored at ""0"" (no pain) and ""10"" (The worst pain imaginable).

Heart failure is a serious condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can lead to symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, and poor growth in children.

The study treatment, finerenone (also called BAY94-8862), works by blocking a protein involved in inflammation, scarring, and thickening of the heart and blood vessels. This may help the heart to pump blood more effectively. This is the first study to explore its use specifically for children with heart failure and LVSD.

The main purpose of this study is to learn if finerenone works to help the heart compared to placebo in children with heart failure and LVSD. For this, the researchers will collect and analyze data on the levels of a protein called NT-proBNP in the blood, which indicates heart stress, and monitor the safety of the treatment.

The study will include children with heart failure and LVSD aged from 6 months to less than 18 years. The study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Based on their group, they will receive either finerenone or a placebo for a duration of 3 months. A placebo looks like a treatment but does not have any medicine in it. Throughout the study, all participants will continue to receive their standard heart failure treatments.

At the start of this study, the doctors will check each participant's medical history and current medications.

This recommendation for traditional SLNB is due to the risk of finding invasive cancer during surgical evaluation of the mastectomy specimen and the inability to accurately map the lymphatic channels once the breast is removed.

In a study by Herremans et al, the majority of traditional SLNBs were demonstrated to be unnecessary. By using Magtrace, a novel iron based lymphatic mapping agent, a delayed SLNB could eliminate these unnecessary traditional SLNBs.

Magtrace, or superparamagnetic oxide (SPIO), was developed in 2018. Unlike traditional mapping agents of blue dye and technetium that clear the body within 24-48 hours, Magtrace remains in the lymph nodes for at least 4 weeks. Magtrace's ability to remain in the lymph node allows accurate mapping of the lymph nodes at the time of the mastectomy with the ability to return to the operating room for a delayed sentinel lymph node biopsy if invasive cancer is found on final pathology.

Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called polatuzumab, linked to a drug called vedotin. Polatuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers.

The investigators also seek to evaluate the potential for practice-based learning and improvement of complex balance tasks in this population, to gain experience for conducting future rehabilitation studies.

Participants for this study will be found using a group called the Friedreich's Ataxia Global Clinical Consortium (FA GCC) UNIFIED Natural History Study (UNIFAI). The FA-GCC is a group of study research centers that helps provide clinical care for FA patients and also helps researchers learn more about how FA affects patients over a long time.

The main objective of this study is to collect safety information in participants with FA from UNIFAI.

Some of the participants will have started taking BIIB141 after joining UNIFAI, but less than 12 months before joining this study.

The main questions researchers want to answer in this study are:

* How many participants had serious adverse events (SAEs)? An adverse event is considered serious when it results in death, is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or requires hospital care.
* How many participants had adverse events (AEs) related to heart failure or liver damage caused by the drug?

Researchers will also learn more about :

• Why and when participants stopped treatment, left the study, or took more of the drug than was prescribed

This study will be done as follows:

* Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study.
* After joining the study, the participants who had never started BIIB141 treatment before must start it within 6 months. Otherwise, all participants will take BIIB141 throughout this study as prescribed by their own doctor.

Removal of female ancillary organs, both in pre and post-menopausal stages is associated with reduction in various quality of life metrics, including sexual health, cognitive decline and depression. Furthermore, removal of ovaries has been associated with increased cardiovascular events, metabolic acidosis, osteoporosis and bone fractures. In premenopausal women, the removal of the ovaries is associated with increased all-cause mortality. From an oncologic standpoint, multi institutional retrospective reviews have demonstrated certain pre-operative radiographic and cystoscopic risk factors that are associated with bladder cancer involvement of female reproductive organs. The absence of these unfavorable risk factors may provide an opportunity to spare women from undergoing unnecessary reproductive organ removal during RC.

Mortality rates of cardiac arrest range from 60-85%, and approximately 80% of survivors are initially comatose. Of those who survive, 50% are left with a permanent neurological disability, and only 10% are able to resume their former lifestyle. Early prognosis of comatose patients after cardiac arrest is critical for management of these patients, yet predicting outcome for these patients remains quite challenging.

The primary study objective of SPARE is to assess the value of using a systematic, multi-modal approach for neuroprognostication in the unconscious post-cardiac arrest population. We hypothesize that prognostication using this approach will be significantly improved compared to historical controls. This approach will be novel because:

All patients who are unconscious at least 24 hours post-cardiac arrest, whereas previous studies on neurologic outcome tended to have restrictive inclusion criteria, such as no pre-existing neurologic impairment (e.g. dementia or prior cerebrovascular injury), or included an unduly restrictive population, such as patients with a strictly comatose state.

The prognostic modalities used to assess patients will be applied at specific time points that will maximize their utility.

Patients' families and clinicians will be encouraged to provide adequate time to allow for a delayed recovery, especially in cases of uncertain outcome, thus minimizing the self-fulfilling prophesy bias of early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies (WLST). This will be particularly pertinent in the comparison of US and Brazil/Italy patients, as the Brazilian and Italian populations are not commonly exposed to premature WLST (as can be the case in the US), one of the major sources of biases in prognostication studies of cardiac arrest due to the self-fulfilling prophecy.",,"modified Rankin Score (mRS): A 7-point scale that measures the level of disability or impairment. mRS 0-3 is considered a good outcome while mRS is considered a poor outcome (14 days, 3 months post-arrest, 6 months, and annually up to 5 years afterwards)",,2017-08-02,2027-08,2027-08,2025-12

Preserving functional ability is a crucial public health priority, with the potential to reduce healthcare costs and enhance older adults' quality of life. Declines in balance and walking ability threaten independence. These declines are attributed to spinal network impairments and may be mitigated by targeted interventions aimed at addressing age-related spinal cord impairment to enhance functional outcomes. However, there is a lack of research into how the aging spinal cord affects balance/walking. In older adults, the spinal cord is less excitable, conducts signals more slowly, and is subject to neural noise. Intervening on age-related impairment of the spinal cord to improve balance/walking ability is a very promising but untapped area of research. A therapeutic approach that combines dynamic balance training with non-invasive electrical spinal stimulation may be effective in preserving functional abilities.

DBS involves delivering continuous stimulation to the brain through electrodes permanently implanted in the thalamus. Despite proven effectiveness, the long-term benefit of DBS can wane over time (habituation) and side effects, including paresthesia and dysarthria, often limit the amplitude of the stimulation, resulting in suboptimal control of tremor. In clinical practice, many groups advise patients to switch their devices off at night to avoid habituation and reduce side effects. However, manually turning off the device at night can result in uncontrolled tremor when the patient moves at night.

This study has 2 goals: 1) optimizing radiation for patients who respond well to induction chemotherapy to diminish spinal cord relapses, 2) utilizing higher dose chemotherapy followed by conventional RT in patients who did not respond to induction chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin, etoposide, ifosfamide, and thiotepa, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays or high-energy protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Studies have shown that patients with newly-diagnosed localized NGGCT, whose disease responds well to chemotherapy before receiving radiation therapy, are more likely to be free of the disease for a longer time than are patients for whom the chemotherapy does not efficiently eliminate or reduce the size of the tumor. The purpose of this study is to see how well the tumors respond to induction chemotherapy to decide what treatment to give next. Some patients will be given RT to the spine and a portion of the brain. Others will be given high dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant before RT to the whole brain and spine.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin, cytarabine, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CPX-351 is made up of daunorubicin and cytarabine and is made in a way that makes the drugs stay in the bone marrow longer and could be less likely to cause heart problems than traditional anthracycline drugs, a common class of chemotherapy drug. Some acute myeloid leukemia patients have an abnormality in the structure of a gene called FLT3. Genes are pieces of DNA (molecules that carry instructions for development, functioning, growth and reproduction) inside each cell that tell the cell what to do and when to grow and divide. FLT3 plays an important role in the normal making of blood cells. This gene can have permanent changes that cause it to function abnormally by making cancer cells grow. Gilteritinib may block the abnormal function of the FLT3 gene that makes cancer cells grow. The overall goals of this study are, 1) to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of CPX-351 with daunorubicin and cytarabine on people with newly diagnosed AML to find out which is better, 2) to study the effects, good and/or bad, of adding gilteritinib to AML therapy for patients with high amounts of FLT3/ITD or other FLT3 mutations and 3) to study changes in heart function during and after treatment for AML.

In Part 1, different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of ASP3082 by itself, or together with cetuximab. Any medical problems will be recorded at each dose. This is done to find suitable doses of ASP3082, by itself or together with cetuximab, to use in Part 2 of the study. The first group will receive the lowest dose of ASP3082.

The accrual of data from the laboratory and from epidemiologic and prevention trials has improved the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Genetic and immunologic factors play a key role in the development of T1DM, and characterization of the early metabolic abnormalities in T1DM is steadily increasing. However, information regarding the natural history of T1DM remains incomplete. The TrialNet Natural History Study of the Development of T1DM (Pathway to Prevention Study) has been designed to clarify this picture, and in so doing, will contribute to the development and implementation of studies aimed at prevention of and early treatment in T1DM.

Purpose:

TrialNet is an international network dedicated to the study, prevention, and early treatment of type 1 diabetes. TrialNet sites are located throughout the United States, Canada, Finland, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and New Zealand. TrialNet is dedicated to testing new approaches to the prevention of and early intervention for type 1 diabetes.

The goal of the TrialNet Natural History Study of the Development of Type 1 Diabetes is to enhance our understanding of the demographic, immunologic, and metabolic characteristics of individuals at risk for developing type 1 diabetes.

The Natural History Study will screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to identify those at risk for developing the disease. Relatives of people with type 1 diabetes have about a 5% percent chance of being positive for the antibodies associated with diabetes. TrialNet will identify adults and children at risk for developing diabetes by testing for the presence of these antibodies in the blood. A positive antibody test is an early indication that damage to insulin-secreting cells may have begun. If this test is positive, additional testing will be offered to determine the likelihood that a person may develop diabetes.

Many types of tumors tend to lose cells or release different types of cellular products including their DNA which is referred to as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) into the bloodstream before changes can be seen on scans. Health care providers can measure the level of ctDNA in blood or other bodily fluids to determine which patients are at higher risk for disease progression or relapse. In this study, a blood test is used to measure ctDNA and see if there is still cancer somewhere in the body after surgery and if giving a treatment will help eliminate the cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and relatlimab, can help the body's immune system to attack the cancer, and can interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial may help doctors determine if ctDNA measurement in blood can better identify patients that need additional treatment, if treatment with nivolumab prolongs patients' life and whether the additional immunotherapy treatment with relatlimab extends time without disease progression or prolongs life of urothelial cancer patients who have undergone surgical removal of their bladder, kidney, ureter or urethra.",Biospecimen Collection; cfDNA or ctDNA Measurement; Computed Tomography; Cystoscopy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Nivolumab; Questionnaire Administration; Relatlimab,"Proportion of patients who are circulating tumor DNA negative (ctDNA[-]) (Cohort A Phase II): Will be determined for each treatment arm as the number of patients who are ctDNA(-) after 12 weeks of treatment divided by the total number of patients on the treatment arm.
